# 🎲 Number Guessing Game - Codveda Internship Task

Welcome to my Python project – **Number Guessing Game**, created as part of the **Codveda Technology Python Development Internship**. This simple yet interactive program lets users guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 📌 Description

The game randomly selects a number from 1 to 100, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides helpful feedback like:

- 🔼 "Too low"  
- 🔽 "Too high"  
- 🎉 "Correct guess!"

The program also handles invalid inputs (like strings or special characters) gracefully.

## ✅ Features

- Random number generation using Python's `random` module  
- Clean user interface via terminal  
- Tracks number of attempts  
- Input validation using exception handling  
- Feedback on each guess  
- Optionally supports limited attempts (e.g., 10 chances)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** `random`, `built-in input()`

## 🚀 How to Run the Program

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
3. Run the script:
```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
```
